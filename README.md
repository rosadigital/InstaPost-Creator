## ‚öôÔ∏è Project demonstration (demontra√ß√£o do projeto)
The algorithm automatically creates a post for an Instagram that talks about Brazilians women in science, as follows:

<p align="center"> <img alt="post_example.JPG" title="post_example.JPG" src="./assets/post_example.JPG" width="400px">

The process is simple:
- the user runs the code, and types the name of famous women in science;
- the algorithm search, and scraps information and photo of this person on Wikipedia (although it is also possible to write your own post, without getting a text from Wikipedia);
-- the text information scrapped are adjusted to 200 characters to create a post, and 2000 to create a description to the post;
- these data are adjusted to a PPTX (which has to be previously formated); 
- the algorithm converts the PPTX to JPG; and
- the algorithm posts the JPG and its description on the Instagram user's profile.

As a result, it is possible to create a post based on information on Wikipedia, and post on Instagram in less than 1 minute.
The following shows a series of automatic posts made on the account @somosmulhersdobrasil, as follows:

<p align="center"> <img alt="insta_page_example.JPG" title="insta_page_example.JPG" src="./assets/insta_page_example.JPG" width="400px">

Recommendation:
- Before you start, it is important to access the PPTX model and configure your own slide structure, i.e. changing the background color, fonts, and so on.

Suggestions for the future:
- Create an executable and a user interface that allows users to use this app without an IDE.
- Develop a way to surpass the necessity of reviewing the PPTX before the post.
